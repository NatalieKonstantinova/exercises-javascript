theory: |

  You can combine logical expressions to create increasingly cleverer and more useful checks. One good example is password verification. As you know, some websites want a password of 8 to 20 characters on signup. Frankly, it's a weird restriction, but whatever, it is what it is. In math, we would write `8 < x < 20` (where `x` is the length of a particular password), but that trick won't work in JavaScript.  We would have to make two separate logical expressions and connect them with the special "AND" operator:

  ```
  A password longer than 8 characters **AND** a password shorter than 20 characters.
  ```

  Here's a function that takes the password and says whether it meets the conditions or not:

  ```javascript
  const isStrongPassword = (password) => {
    const length = password.length;
    return length > 8 && length < 20;
  };

  isStrongPassword('qwerty'); // false
  isStrongPassword('qwerty1234'); // true
  isStrongPassword('zxcvbnmasdfghjkqwertyui'); // false
  ```

  `&&` means "AND" (called a conjunction in mathematical logic). The whole expression is true only when every operand, which are all part of the compound expressions, is true. In other words, `&&` means "both".

  This operator's priority is lower than that of comparison operators, so the expression works correctly without parentheses.

  Another widespread operator along with `&&` is `||` â€” "OR" (disjunction). It means "one or the other, or both". Operators can be combined in any number and any sequence, but when `&&` and `||` appear together, you should label priority with parentheses. Below is an example of an advanced function validating a password:

  ```javascript
  const hasSpecialChars = (str) => /* checks for special characters in the string */;

  const isStrongPassword = (password) => {
    const length = password.length;
    // The parentheses set the priority, making it clear how each part is related
    return (length > 8 && length < 20) || hasSpecialChars(password);
  };
  ```

  Another example. We want to buy an apartment that meets these conditions: an area of 100 square meters or more on any street **OR** an area of 80 square meters or more, but on `Main Street`.

  We'll write a function checking the apartment. It takes two arguments: the area (a number) and the street name (a string):

  ```javascript
  const isGoodApartment = (area, street) => {
    // Via a variable to make sure the function is not too long
    const result = area >= 100 || (area >= 80 && street === 'Main Street');
    return result;
  };

  isGoodApartment(91, 'Queens Street'); // false
  isGoodApartment(78, 'Queens Street'); // false
  isGoodApartment(70, 'Main Street');   // false

  isGoodApartment(120, 'Queens Street'); // true
  isGoodApartment(120, 'Main Street');   // true
  isGoodApartment(80, 'Main Street');    // true
  ```

  The area of mathematics dealing with logical operators is called Boolean algebra. The "truth tables" are shown below and can be used to figure out the result of an operator:

  ## AND `&&`

  | A     | B     | A && B   |
  |-------| ------|----------|
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE    |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE    |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE    |

  Few examples:

  ```javascript
  // true && true;
  3 > 2 && 'wow'.startsWith('w'); // true

  // true && false;
  'start' === 'start' && 8 < 3; // false
  ```

  ## OR `||`

  | A     | B     | A &vert;&vert; B |
  |-------|-------|----------|
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | **TRUE** |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE    |

  Few examples:

  ```javascript
  // true || true;
  3 > 2 || 'wow'.startsWith('w'); // true

  // false || false;
  'start' === 'Start' || 3 < 3; // false
  ```

instructions: |

  Write a function, `isLeapYear()`, to determine whether a year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a multiple of 400 (i.e. divisible without a remainder), or it is both a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100. As you can see, the definition already contains all the required logic, all we need to do is to put it into code:

  ```javascript
  isLeapYear(2018); // false
  isLeapYear(2017); // false
  isLeapYear(2016); // true
  ```

  You can test multiplicity as follows:

  ```javascript
  // % - returns the remainder after dividing the left operand by the right one
  // Check if number is a multiple of 10
  number % 10 === 0

  // Check if number is not a multiple of 10
  number % 10 !== 0
  ```
