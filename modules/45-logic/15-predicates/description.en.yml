name: Predicates
theory: |

  Remember the `isInfant()` function from the last lesson:

  ```javascript
  const isInfant = (age) => age < 1;
  console.log(isInfant(3));
  ```

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>false</pre>

  This kind of function is called a predicate. Predicate functions answer a question and always (without exception!) return either `true` or `false`.

  Predicates usually have handy names in every language for simplicity of analysis. In JavaScript, predicates generally begin with `is`, `has`, or `can`, though it's not limited to just those words. Examples:

    * `isInfant()` - "is he an infant?"
    * `hasChildren()` - "does he have children?"
    * `isEmpty()` - "is it empty?"
    * `hasErrors()` - "are there any errors?"

  **Only** a function returning a boolean can be considered a predicate.

  Let's write one more predicate function. It takes a string and checks if it's the word `'Castle'`:

  ```javascript
  const isCastle = (type) => type === 'Castle';

  console.log(isCastle('Sea'));
  ```

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>false</pre>


instructions: |

  Write the function `isMister()` that takes a string and checks if it's the word `'Mister'`.

  Examples:

  ```javascript
  isMister('Mister'); // true
  isMister('Miss');   // false
  ```
