name: Data Types
theory: |

  What happens if we try to multiply a number by a string? JavaScript will return `NaN` (not a number) value which we've seen before. This happens whenever incompatible values are used together. In this case, a number and a string:

  ```javascript
  3 * 'Dracarys'; // NaN
  ```

  In high-level programming languages, data is categorized by type. A string refers to the String type, while numbers refer to Number and BigInt (very large numbers). What are these data types for? It's to help protect your program from hard-to-find errors. Types determine two things:

  * Possible values.  For example, numbers in JavaScript are divided into two types: Number and BigInt. All numbers below a certain threshold (you can check it) belong to the Numbers data type, and all numbers above that threshold belong to the Biglnt type. They're divided this way due to the hardware's technical features.
  * A set of operations that can be executed upon this type. For example, you can multiply integers, but not strings. Multiplying the word "mother" by the word "notepad" makes no sense.

  Javascript may act in one of two possible ways when it sees a violation. In some situations, it'll terminate the program with an error. In others, the program will continue to work. In the second case, the invalid operation will return something like `NaN`, as in the example above.

  How does JavaScript detect the data type? It's quite simple. Any value entered will be initialized and, depending on how it's initialized, it'll understand what type of data it is. Numbers, for instance, are just numbers without any extra characters, apart from the point (.) for rational numbers. Strings, on the other hand, are always written between special characters (there are three ways to write strings in JavaScript). For example, `'234'` is a string, even though there are numbers written between quotes.

  You can find out data type using `typeof` operator:

  ```javascript
  typeof 3; // 'number'
  typeof 'Game'; // 'string'
  ```

  The Number, BigInt, and String data types are *primitive* types, because they consist of a single value of that type. But this is not always the case. JavaScript has a built-in composite type Object ( as well as arrays, dates and others based on it). It can be used to combine data of different types into a single value, e.g. we can create a user by adding their name and age.

  ```javascript
  // Learnt this syntax in Hexlet
  const user = { name: 'Toto', age: 33 };
  ```

  Note that there are two lines but only one string in the code above.
