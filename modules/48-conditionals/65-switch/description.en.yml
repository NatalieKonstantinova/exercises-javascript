name: The `switch` statement
theory: |

  Many languages contain **switch** in addition to the conditional *if* construct. This is a customized version of *if*, designed for special cases. For example, you can use it where there is an *if else* chain with equality checks:

  ```javascript
  if (status === 'processing') {
    // First
  } else if (status === 'paid') {
    // Second
  } else if (status === 'new') {
    // Third
  } else {
    // Fourth
  }
  ```

  This compound check has one distinctive feature: each branch here is a check of the `status` variable value. 'Switch' allows to write such code in a shorter and more expressive way:

  ```javascript
  switch (status) {
    case 'processing': // status == processing
      // First
      break;
    case 'paid': // status == paid
      // Second
      break;
    case 'new': // status == new
      // Third
      break;
    default: // else
      // Fourth
  }
  ```

  Switch is a rather advanced construct considering the number of elements it consists of:

  * An external definition containing the keyword `switch`. A variable whose values `switch` will use to select a behavior. And curly brackets for behavior branches.
  * The `case` and `default` constructs, where the behavior for different variable values is described. Each `case` corresponds to `if` in the example above. `default` is a special condition corresponding to the `else` branch in conditionals. Neither `else` nor `default` is necessary (but the linter always [asks for it](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/default-case)).
  * `break` is needed to prevent "fall-through". If `break` is omitted, the program continues execution at the next `case` statement after the required `case` is executed until the next `break` or the end of *switch*.

  The curly brackets in `switch* don't specify a code block unlike elsewhere. Only the syntax shown above is acceptable. Meaning, you can use `case` or `default` there. But inside each `case` (and `default`) things are different. You can execute any arbitrary code here:

  ```javascript
  switch (count) {
    case 1:
      // Do something useful
      break;
    case 2:
      // Do something useful
      break;
    default:
      // Do something
  }
  ```

  Sometimes the `case` output is the end of a function containing *switch*. If this happens, you need to return it outside somehow. There are two ways to solve this problem.

  First. Create a variable before *switch*, fill it in *case* and then, at the end, return the value of that variable to the outside.

  ```javascript
  (count) => {
    // Declare a variable
    let result;

    // Fill it
    switch (count) {
      case 1:
        result = 'one';
        break;
      case 2:
        result = 'two';
        break;
      default:
        result = null;
    }

    // Return
    return result;
  };
  ```

  The second way is easier and shorter. Instead of creating a variable, *case* allows us to make a regular function return inside it. And since no code is executed after `return`, we can get rid of `break`:

  ```javascript
  (count) => {
    switch (count) {
      case 1:
        return 'one';
      case 2:
        return 'two';
      default:
        return null;
    }
  };
  ```

  Though switch is present in the code, you always can find a way to avoid it. The key benefit of using it is that it better expresses the programmer's intention when checking the values of a particular variable. Although the code becomes a bit longer, it's easier to read compared to *else if* blocks.

  Write the `getNumberExplanation()` function that describes a given input number. If there is no explanation available, it returns `null`:

  ```javascript
  getNumberExplanation(8);   // null

  // Only the following numbers have descriptions
  getNumberExplanation(666); // 'devil number'
  getNumberExplanation(42);  // 'answer for everything'
  getNumberExplanation(7);   // 'prime number'
  ```
